   ðŸš€ **Key Differences Between C++ and C# in Static Variables**:

   1. **Static Variable Initialization**:
      - In **C++**, static variables must be defined outside the class using the `ClassName::var` syntax.
      - In **C#**, static variables can be initialized directly **inside the class** (no need for definition outside the class).
      - Example (C#): `public static int x = 1337;`

   2. **Modifying Static Variables**:
      - In **C++**, you can modify static variables **using an object** (but it's still recommended to use the class name).
      - In **C#**, static variables must be modified using the **class name**, as static members belong to the class and not instances.
      - Example (C#): `StaticDifferences.x = 42;` (No object is needed here)

   3. **Accessing Static Members**:
      - In both **C++** and **C#**, static members belong to the class itself and can be accessed without an object.
      - **C#** requires you to explicitly access static members using the **class name** (e.g., `StaticDifferences.x`), whereas **C++** allows access via both the class name and object.

   4. **Static Methods**:
      - Both languages support **static methods** that can access and modify static variables.
      - In **C++**, static methods can be called via the class name or an object, while in **C#**, static methods must always be called via the class name.

   5. **Memory**:
      - Both C++ and C# use shared memory for static variables, meaning that all instances of the class share the same static variable.
      - However, C# manages memory via the .NET runtime, while C++ gives you manual control over memory allocation.

   **Summary**:
   - Static variables and methods are similar in both languages but require different syntax for initialization and modification.
   - C# enforces a more structured approach by restricting the modification of static members via class names, while C++ is a bit more flexible.
