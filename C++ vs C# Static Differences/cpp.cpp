   üîç **Static Members in C++**:

   In C++, `static` members belong to the class itself, rather than to any individual instance. This means they share the same memory across all instances of the class. Static variables retain their value between function calls and across different objects of the class. There are a few important concepts when dealing with `static`:

   1. **Static Variables**: These variables are shared across all instances of the class. They must be defined outside the class, even though they are declared inside it.

   2. **Static Methods**: These methods can only access static variables and cannot use instance-specific variables. They can be called without creating an object of the class.

   3. **Initialization of Static Variables**: Static variables are not initialized when declared inside the class. They must be defined and initialized outside the class.

   üéØ **Key Tricks**:
   - Static members allow you to share data across all instances.
   - Static methods don't need an object to be called and can only access static data.
   - Static variables retain their state across function calls.
